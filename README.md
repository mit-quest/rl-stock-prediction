# rl-stock-prediction

### Goal
The Goal of this notebook is to compare two different ML models in stock prediction, and profit generation. The approach the problem from a Supervised Learning approach, as well as from a Reinforcement Learning approach. 

The creation,training, and testing of both models can be found under the corresponding 'Supervised Learning' and 'Reinforcement Learning' directories. Our Final notebook, comparing the two is titled 'RL vs SL'. In this notebook, we compare our findings using both models and state our conclusions.


### About Us

We are two sophomores at MIT conducting this research in MIT's Quest for Intelligence Lab. The two of us are both fairly new to Machine Learning, so we hoped to take on this project to learn more about the field and to broaden our knowledge of ML applications.
